## Objectives

1. Build an Express controller.

## Instructions

This lab is incomplete and has no tests. 

Just to be safe, before starting the tests or the server, run `npm install` in your terminal.

You can run the tests with `learn`.

To start your application, type `npm start`. The IDE will give you an IP address and port for your application, locally, your application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
